# MAPS GeoNetwork Catalogue Metadata SignOff
What is GeoNetwork?
GeoNetwork is a data cataloguing application:
-	to manage spatially referenced resources. 
-	It provides powerful metadata editing and search functions as well as an interactive web map viewer. 
-	It allocates a unique identifier to each metadata record that can be used to search/reference it in other MAPS systems.
-	provides an easy-to-use web interface to search geospatial data across multiple catalogues
-	All types of data, i.e., maps or even non-geographic datasets can be described in the catalogue
-	The metadata is captured using ISO19115/119/110 standards ensuring interoperability with other platforms.
-	Based on user profiles (e.g., reviewer, editor), a dashboard provides easy access to their information and tasks. 
-	Online editing of metadata is based on a powerful template system and directories of information (e.g., contacts, thesaurus).
-	The editor provides uploading of data, graphics, documents, pdf files and any other content type. 
-	It is currently used in numerous Spatial Data Infrastructure initiatives across the world e.g., FAO Map Catalogue

MAPS GeoNetwork deliverables are:
-	To Keep an up-to-date metadata record of each data resource used in the MAPS tool.
-	To detail all data processing methods that were used to process MAPS data
-	Where permissible, to share the resource/resource location to facilitate ease of access for our users.

MAPS GitHub metadata sign-off approach
- Open an issue using the signoff template with the sihnoff checklist
-	Each metadata record will be created as one issue quoting the GeoNetwork unique identifier. 
- The issue assigned to @dzvoti who manages this project
